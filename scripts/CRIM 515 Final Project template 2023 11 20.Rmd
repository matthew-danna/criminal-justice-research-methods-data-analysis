Some intro text




# Example Section
```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, results='hide', fig.show='hide', warning=FALSE, error=FALSE}
# when you set 'echo' to false, you are hiding the block of code 
# when you set 'message' to false, you are hiding the console text that comes after running your code
# when you set 'results' to hide, you are hiding extra processing that occasionally shows up in the console
# when you set fig.show to hide, you are hiding the plot output
```
See how the chunk of code above doesn't show up in the knitted output? It's magic, really.
